Maxwell is a graphical user interface-based tool for calculating heat loss and heat gain in a building.  Gain and loss can be calculated for the building as a whole or on a room-by-room or zone-by-zone basis.  This helps users to select HVAC equipment that is appropriate for the climate of Northwestern Pennsylvania.
